            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>I felt inspired by several different things. In no particular order:</p>
                <h3>Abandoned Exploration</h3>
                <p>I enjoy watching videos and seeing photography of abandoned places around the world. There is a somber, lonely feeling to them.</p>

                <h3>The Backrooms</h3>
                <p>The horrific idea of the Backrooms, which started as a 4chan post, really inspired me. The feeling of being in a place so familiar yet unfamiliar is so terrifying to myself.
                    I think what makes the Backrooms so unnerving, is the feeling of 'emptiness' and the discomfort of being in a completely empty place.
                </p>

                <h3>Being Lost in a Mall</h3>
                <p>
                    Being lost in a shopping center as a child is a very stressful experience, and I wanted to capture this stressful feeling within my game.
                </p>

                <h3>Exploratory Horror Games (Silent Hill Series)</h3>
                <p>
                    I have played the Silent Hill games using Emulator or on the Playstation 2-3 as a child, and I loved that the games were open to partially-open world, 
                    yet filled with horror- which was unusual in the 2000-2010s, as many horror games were in enclosed, controlled environments with a more linear progression system.
